            <p> Hello my name is Alexis! </p>
            <p>I'm a current Junior in High School in New York City. Before I started to code 3 years ago during the begining of freshmen year of high-school</p>
            <p> I was always interested in tech at a young age, so when I decided to start code I really was interested in learning more </p>
            <p> which lead me to look for more oppritunities that can further expand my skills, which later took me to join Accenture as an Apprentice</p>
